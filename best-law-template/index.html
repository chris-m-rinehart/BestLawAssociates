            <p>Joseph Best is licensed to practice law in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. He focuses his immigration practice on employment-based and family-based immigrant visas. He does many waivers of inadmissibility before USCIS and the Immigration Court. He also provides effective removal defense representation before courts from Philadelphia, Newark, New York, Hartford and Boston. Joseph has successfully served clients from over 100 different countries in a broad array of complex legal matters.
                Joseph is a 2008 graduate of Villanova University School of Law. Joseph was one of three public interest scholarship recipients. He received the American Law Institute / American Bar Association award for student leadership and scholarship, as well as the Dorothy Day award for public service. Joseph completed previous graduate and undergraduate studies abroad in Belgium and France as a recipient of a Rotary International fellowship. He obtained a Master’s Degree in political thought from New York University, Institute of French Studies funded fully by the NYU Presidential Fellowship Program.
                As a longtime entrepreneur, Joseph has a varied professional history outside the practice of law. Joseph has worked previously as a community AIDS activist in epidemiological research administration, in French antique importation, in real estate sales of historic properties and in business management consulting. He calls upon both his advocacy experience and his business acumen in resolving his clients’ unique legal issues.
                As a committed advocate for immigrants, Joseph formed Best & Associates, LLP in 2011 in order to provide clients with a broad scope of services and expertise. He is passionate about the benefits that a sound national immigration system brings to American society.  He speaks and writes widely on the subject of the continued social, economic, and political dynamism that immigration brings to America.
                Best & Associates LLP is committed to the public interest. We strive in accordance with a political and social vision in which the world’s best, brightest and most deserving individuals can legally find a secure and productive home in America. Resolving our clients’ complex immigration related matters is not so much demanding or painstaking as it is invigorating to us, the practitioners.  It’s the truth when we say it:
                We love what we do. We think you will too!</p>
